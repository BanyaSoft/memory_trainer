Log of changes:
1. ClearConsole now have keepFirstLine := true as default value
2. SetConsoleDifficulty launched before game starts and get difficulty lvl from player
3. Now all the functions and procedures have their prototypes at the beginning of the file program.
It's done because of large amount of calling subprograms from other ones to avoid complexity with
the order of functions in the program.
4. Stage1...Stage5 arguments were changed (difficulty: integer was added)
5. LoadDictionary folder was deleted from repository
6. May be other little improvements, I dont remember ;)
